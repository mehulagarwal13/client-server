Build a complete, fully functional, end-to-end role-based mentorship platform where two types of users exist: Students and Mentors. Implement the entire signup, login, authentication, and profile creation flow for both roles, ensuring every route, service, controller, and database schema is correctly set up without any missing or unregistered routes. For Students, create a complete signup system that collects personal details, education, skills, goals, career status, and mentorship preferences, and ensure the backend route POST /api/students/register is fully implemented with validation, password hashing, duplicate email checking, and successful database insertion. Similarly, create a full signup and login system for Mentors with fields like expertise, experience, specialization, achievements, portfolio links, availability, and mentorship areas and ensure the backend route POST /api/mentors/register is fully implemented with complete validation and data storage. For both roles, implement login using JWT authentication and return their role, profile, and token so the frontend can redirect them to a role-based dashboard. Create a dedicated Student Dashboard that shows study materials, roadmaps, community groups, and chat access. Create a dedicated Mentor Dashboard where mentors can manage students, create groups, moderate discussions, approve mentorship requests, and chat with students. Now build a complete real-time Community Chatroom system that supports group chat and private one-to-one chat between students and mentors. Implement backend routes such as /api/chat/group, /api/chat/private, /api/chat/messages/:id, and /api/chat/send, and ensure all of them are properly registered in the server with no missing imports or mismatched paths. Implement a real-time WebSocket or Socket.IO layer that handles essential chat events such as joining and leaving rooms, sending and receiving messages, typing indicators, stopping typing, group creation, and message updates. The chat system must support text, images, files, emojis, replies, message reactions, read receipts, timestamps, and auto scroll. Create a complete database structure for chat that includes Users, Groups, PrivateChats, and Messages with fields for sender, content, timestamps, seen status, and attachments. Design a modern chat UI with a left sidebar showing groups and private chats, a main chat area that updates messages live, and a right sidebar showing group details, members, mentor badges, and shared media. Ensure role-based access: students can join groups, ask doubts, send messages, and start private chats, while mentors can create groups, moderate groups, add or remove students, pin messages, and send announcements. Make sure the entire system—signup, login, dashboards, chatrooms, groups, profiles, and real-time communication—works smoothly with frontend and backend perfectly connected, every route registered, every request reaching the correct controller, and the UI updating in real time without errors such as ‘This route is not registered in the student service.’ Deliver the entire platform fully functional, stable, responsive, and production-ready
